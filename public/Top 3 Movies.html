 <h1>The best movies according to Stephon</h1>
 <h2>the top three movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Fight Club</h3>
 <p>I think brad pitt was amazing and considering this is the only movie i saw him in its a pretty good first impression of him as an actor</p>
<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
<p>the special effects were great and i think that the movie deserves a lot of rewatches to pick up on all of the messages. the core message was lost on me</p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>A tear wrenching love story with ryan gosling and Rachcel Mcadams, a complete
    timeless movie about love withstanding the test of time.
